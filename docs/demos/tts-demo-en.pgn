{The Scandinavian Defense: Black immediately challenges the e4 pawn. White needs to recapture and fight for the center.}
1. e4 d5 2. Nc3 dxe4 3. Nxe4 {[%cal Ge4d6,Ge4f6,Ge4c5] Recapturing with the knight is excellent. It lands on a powerful central square, radiating influence in every direction.} Bf5 {This is the whole point of the Scandinavian for Black -- the light-squared bishop develops before the pawns block it in.} 4. d3 Be6 5. Qf3 {[%cal Gf3f7,Gf3f5] The queen eyes both f7 and the bishop on f5. Black needs to be careful.} a5 6. c4 c6 7. Bf4 Na6 8. b3 b6 9. d4 {White opens the center with a strong pawn push.} Ra7 10. Bd3 Qxd4?! {[%csl Rg8,Rf8,Rh8] Grabbing the pawn looks tempting, but Black's entire kingside is still asleep. The king is stuck in the center with nothing developed.} 11. O-O-O! {[%cal Gd1d4,Gc1d1] Castling queenside with tempo! The rook lands on the d-file aiming straight at Black's queen.} Nb4 12. Ne2 Nxd3+ 13. Rxd3 Qa1+ 14. Kd2 Qb2+ 15. Ke3 Rd7 16. Rhd1 Nf6 17. Nxf6+! {[%cal Gf3c6] A strong recapture that rips open Black's pawn cover. The queen now has a clear path into c6.} exf6 18. Qxc6! {The queen infiltrates. Black's position is falling apart with too many weak squares.} Bc5+ 19. Kf3 Ke7 20. Rxd7+ Bxd7 21. Qxd7+ Kf8 22. Qd8# {[%csl Gd8] Checkmate! White's queen and rook dominated the d-file from start to finish. The key lesson: don't grab pawns with your queen when your king is still in the center.} 1-0
